# Dynamic Programming Assignment

In this assignment, I learned different ways of programming the same function, their advantages, and their disadvantages.
I coded functions to compute fibonacci numbers, and to find the most 
optimal parenthesization for matrix chain multiplication. Each was coded 3 ways, one using traditional (recursive) methods,
one using a memo with recursion, and one using a bottom up (iterative) approach.
